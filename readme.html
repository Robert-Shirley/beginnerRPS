Finished the basis for this project. It is completely functional right now and I did go above and beyond a bit. The UI isn't that much, but Odin wasn't asking for that. I already had a concrete foundation in all types of conditionals, so this was pretty easy honestly. I did struggle to put a function inside of a for loop though, so something I should look into. It took me a while to figure that one out.
